I want to make a book recommendation engine that is fun with books I have already read. It should have many ways of finding a recommended book, like asking questions, or random book, or just saying "Give me the favorite"

But it will have easter eggs. Like my really really favorite books will not be accessible until you use a keyword or something. 

I also want to set up a PR so that when I merge, the app is deployed and the books are blocked until I unblock them. Or maybe a CI/CD with some env variable. I have to be able to change this with my phone.
