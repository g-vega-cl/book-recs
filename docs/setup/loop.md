Our development loop should be:
1. Document our requirements and what we want in a `.md` file
2. Ask AI to ask questions and find blindspots and get more context so it understands what we want.
3. Make a plan for what we want.
4. Execute the plan.
5. Write down our findings in a Document. (same `.md` file)
6. Go back to step 1.
